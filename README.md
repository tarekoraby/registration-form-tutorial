# A Registration Form in Pure Java

This project implements a standard registration form with error handling and cross-field validation. This signup form is developed 100% in pure Java using Vaadin Flow (no HTML or JavaScript involved). Whatâ€™s more, the form is responsive, meaning that it automatically adjusts its content to fit different screen sizes. 

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080/register in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Windows, Linux, macOS).
